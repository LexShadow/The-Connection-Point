The connection point is a updated versions of [Dead Simple Blog](https://github.com/paintedsky/dead-simple-blog) by paintedsky

I have updated the a few things, changes the design and started to work on a few more functions for it, I liked this idea as I did something like
this in the past without markdown, that markdown seems to be a really cool idea, I also have added Font Awesome, ParsedownExta and my own ParsedownExtraFix
that give us Font Awesome.

This version also supports the very same formatting for pages, some of the changes are not ready but I am working as best I can on it, I am wanting this for my own
random blog what I want to use via Tor so this will help me keep this project going.

Other useful things, no JS, easy to use in plain markdown, same system for pages and blogs, in the future comments and more.


## Installation

Download the files and upload them to a webserver somewhere. That's it!


## Usage

1. Edit "index.php" with your text editor of choice, and change the variables at the top to your liking.
2. To Create a blog create a text file with a NUMERIC file name like so YYYY-MM-DD (e.g. 2018-10-30.txt) for the blogs.
3. To Create a page create a text file with a NUMERIC file name like so NNNN (e.g 0001.txt) for pages
4. Format text files with Markdown, or not. Whatever. ;)
5. If you need to link to image/video/audio/etc. files, you can upload them to the media folder.
6. Upload text files to the "content" directory.
7. You're done!!
